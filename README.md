# Studiora â€“ My AI Study Bot for Discord

Studiora is a Discord bot I built to help students (like me) stay organized and study smarter. It uses OpenAI to answer questions, explain code, summarise notes, and more. I made it for fun, but also to practice using APIs, hosting, and building real tools people can use.

Right now, the bot runs 24/7 on Replit, and it automatically creates channels for different study features when it joins a new server.

## ðŸ’¡ What it Can Do

- `!ask` â€” Ask it anything (school, tech, whatever)
- `!summarise` â€” Paste notes or a paragraph and it gives you a quick summary
- `!explaincode` â€” Paste code and it explains what it does
- Auto-creates channels like:
  - `studybot-chat`
  - `studyplan` (coming soon)
  - `flashcards` (coming soon)

More features like `!studyplan` and `!quizme` are coming soon!

## ðŸ›  Tech I Used

- Python (main language)
- Discord.py (for bot stuff)
- OpenAI API (for the AI responses)
- Replit (to host it online 24/7)
- GitHub (to share it and track updates)

## ðŸš€ How to Run It Yourself

If you want to try it:

1. Clone the repo
2. Add your `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` as environment variables (in Replit or .env)
3. Run `bot.py`

Youâ€™ll need a Discord bot account and OpenAI key to get it working.

## âœ¨ Why I Made This

I wanted to make something that mixes AI + studying + real usefulness. Iâ€™m studying computer science and thought itâ€™d be cool to combine what Iâ€™m learning with something other people could actually use.
