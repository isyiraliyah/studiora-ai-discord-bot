# Studiora – My AI Study Bot for Discord

Studiora is a Discord bot I built to help students (like me) stay organized and study smarter. It uses OpenAI to answer questions, explain code, summarise notes, and more. I made it for fun, but also to practice using APIs, hosting, and building real tools people can use.

Right now, the bot runs 24/7 on Replit, and it automatically creates channels for different study features when it joins a new server.

## What it Can Do

- `!ask` — Ask it anything (school, tech, whatever)
- `!summarise` — Paste notes or a paragraph and it gives you a quick summary
- `!explaincode` — Paste code and it explains what it does
- Auto-creates channels like:
  - `studybot-chat`
  - `studyplan` (coming soon)
  - `flashcards` (coming soon)

More features like `!studyplan` and `!quizme` are coming soon.

## Tech I Used

- Python (main language)
- Discord.py (for bot features)
- OpenAI API (for intelligent responses)
- Replit (for 24/7 hosting)
- GitHub (for version control and sharing)

## How to Run It Yourself

If you want to try it:

1. Clone this repo
2. Add your `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` as environment variables
   - Either in Replit's Secrets tab or in a local `.env` file
3. Run `main.py`

You’ll need a Discord bot account and OpenAI key to get it working.

## Why I Made This

I wanted to create something useful that blends AI, study tools, and real-world coding. As a computer science student, it was a fun way to apply what I’m learning and build something people might actually want to use.
